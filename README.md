Computer Science Non Exam Assessment for Y12-Y13

As part of the A-level Computer Science syllabus, I must complete a Non Exam Assessment. This entails completing an individual project, that needs to be complex enough to be classed as A-level, and also solve a 'real world problem' (whatever that is [I'm kidding I know]).

For my NEA, I decided to go with something that would not only make my life easier, but also the lives of other people in my computer science class easier. As it stands, we spend forever slogging through experiments and writing results by hand into tables. So what if we could just take a picture of the table and have it created for us?

So I did just that. At the end of this project i will have (at least) two working Neural Networks, that when working in tandem will be able to 'see' a picture of a table, recognise it as such and then build a digital table which can be operated on within excel or using PANDAS, whichever is preferred by the user. The output will be a CSV file, so really you should be able to put it through any data analysis program, and get results from it.

Linting in this repositoty is done using pep8, as pylint failed to play nicely with opencv, and it just helped me to keep things looking consistant overall, any errors that are thrown due to using a different linter are nothing to do with me, because it all works at my end.

The FrozenModel Javascript program in the repository will have to be modified to ensure that the path to your graph file, otherwise the program won't run. In any case, you just need to follow the instructions on the tensorflow webiste to ensure that you set up the tensorflowjs properly, and you can use the models from within the repository to get an idea of how the web app would work. In any case, I recommend training your own models so that you can have more control over what you want, rather than the base set that I have set up in my own case.

I've set up this repository so that I can track my progress through the project, and help for a more efficient write up at the end of the project (as I won't have to remember dates when I did things, they'll just be here). 

Eventually, I'll have several working neural networks, but for now I just gotta keep going.
