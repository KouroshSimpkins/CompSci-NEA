Computer Science Non Exam Assessment for Y12-Y13

As part of the A-level Computer Science syllabus, I must complete a Non Exam Assessment. This entails completing an individual project, that needs to be complex enough to be classed as A-level, and also solve a 'real world problem' (whatever that is [I'm kidding I know]).

For my NEA, I decided to go with something that would not only make my life easier, but also the lives of other people in my computer science class easier. As it stands, we spend forever slogging through experiments and writing results by hand into tables. So what if we could just take a picture of the table and have it created for us?

So I did just that. At the end of this project i will have (at least) two working Neural Networks, that when working in tandem will be able to 'see' a picture of a table, recognise it as such and then build a digital table which can be operated on within excel or using PANDAS, whichever is preferred by the user. The output will be a CSV file, so really you should be able to put it through any data analysis program, and get results from it.

I've set up this repository so that I can track my progress through the project, and help for a more efficient write up at the end of the project (as I won't have to remember dates when I did things, they'll just be here). 

Eventually, I'll have several working neural networks, but for now I just gotta keep going.
